Description: RnaSeqSampleSize package provides a sample size calculation method
    based on negative binomial model and the exact test for assessing
    differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. It controls FDR for 
    multiple testing and utilizes the average read count and dispersion 
    distributions from real data to estimate a more reliable sample size.  
    It is also equipped with several unique features, including estimation for 
    interested genes or pathway, power curve visualization, and parameter 
    optimization.
